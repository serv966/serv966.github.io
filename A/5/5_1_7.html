        <P>The major functions of the microprocessor is to detect the
        front SW operation, to control each device, to control the OSD,
        to switch the frequency, to readout and restore the monitor adjustment
        data and to control the PowerSave. The microprocessor is always
        active while the monitor is powered on.</P>

        <OL>
          <LI><B>SW Control</B><BR>
          The Key-Scan method is adopted at the switch control. The microprocessor
          detects what control SW is operated, with measuring the voltage
          on 95 pin (KY1). <BR>
          The microprocessor also controls the front LED on/off at the
          4 pin (green) and 5 pin (yellow).<BR>

          <LI><B>Data transmission</B><BR>
          The devices controlled by the microprocessor are EEPROM(U353),
          measure gate array(U352) , OSD(U205), Video pre amplifier (U202)
          DSP LSI(U601) and D/A converter (U551, U603, U570). <BR>
          These devices except measure gate array(U352) , OSD(U205) use
          I<SUP>2</SUP>C bus and transfer the data through SCL (29 pin)
          and SDA (30 pin). <BR>
          The measure gate array transmits data through the three-wire
          serial bus (DI: 77 pin, CK: 75 pin and CE: 76 pin). The OSD (U205)
          transmits data through the three-wire serial bus (DI: 31 pin,
          CK: 33 pin and OSD_CE: 84 pin). <BR>

          <LI><B>Self-protecting function<BR>
          </B>The microprocessor monitors whether or not the monitor's
          internal circuit works properly. <BR>
          The output lines that the microprocessor monitors are:<BR>
          * 170 V line<BR>
          * 80 V line<BR>
          * -14 V line<BR>
          * 5V_M line<BR>
          * Each Output voltage of speaker<BR>
          *Horizontal and Vertical oscillation line output by the H. BLK
          and VP_DET<BR>
          *X.pro voltage<BR>
          When any of these line stops outputting, the microprocessor finds
          any trouble that has occurred and stops the voltage except the
          5V_S. The microprocessor leads the monitor's operation to the
          Power Save mode 2 to protect the monitor from further damage.
          Then, the microprocessor notifies the user of the trouble by
          flashing the front Yellow / Green LED. In addition, LED at the
          abnormalities operate by lighting with 8 cycle of the number
          of surveillance. Green blinking tells the unusual factor. This
          is useful when finding the defected part. <BR>
          To cancel the protector function, short between PC (9 pin) and
          GND (10 pin).<BR>

          The gate array always measures the frequency of sync signal input
          both BNC and D-SUB. The measurement is sent to the microprocessor
          as data. The microprocessor reads the power saving information
          such as the existence of the input sync signal as the data.<BR>
          When Auto-Sizing is performed, the gate array measures the Display
          period and Back Porch of the input signal. And at the same time
          , it displays an image on the screen with proper size and position
          by measuring the H_BLK and VP DET. To decide the proper size,
          the gate array measures the Sync and R, G and B video of the
          input signal. From this measurement, the microprocessor calculates
          the Total period and Display period. Then, to decide the proper
          size, the microprocessor uses the data in a ratio of the Display
          period to the Total period. To decide the proper position, the
          gate array measures the wave which follows the H_BLK and VP DET.<BR>

        <P>The factory default data, user adjusted data and setting data
        for the microprocessor are stored within the U353. This data
        can be readout and restored with special utility software such
        as eep.exe. If you exchange the EEPROM, all of the adjusted data
        will be lost. So you need to save the adjusted data in the ROM
        to file before you exchange the EEPROM, or you need to readjust
        and store all of the adjustments after you have exchanged EEPROM.</P>

        <P>When you exchange the EEPROM to a new one and turn on the
        Power SW for the first time, no power phenomenon will occur for
        approximately 6 sec. This is because the microprocessor formats
        the EEPROM, so the phenomenon does not indicate the monitor's
        trouble.</P>
