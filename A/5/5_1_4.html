    <P>The signal coming from the D-sub and/or BNC is input to the
    Analog switch IC (U201). The selected video signal (D-SUB or
    BNC) is output to the video-Pre-Amplifier (U202) from U201. Then,
    the GAIN of R, G and B signals from the U201 are controlled by
    U202 and these signals are mixed with the OSD signal . The R,
    G and B signals are amplified by the video output amplifier (U203).
    Then the cutoff level control IC (U204) controls the cutoff level
    of R, G and B signals output from the U203, and controls the
    black level of the R, G and B signals from U203.</P>

        selected control signal (D/B) is input to the 18pin through the
        measure gate array (U351).<BR>

        The U202 controls the R, G and B gain signals coming from the
        input select IC (U201), and mixes the video signal and the OSD
        signal. The microprocessor (U351) controls these operations of
        the U202 through the I<SUP>2</SUP>C bus. And the U202 has the
        following built-in functions; the Sync Separator Circuit, the
        video blanking, clamp, D/A converter functions, Video signal
        detection circuit, Sharpness and Gamma functions. The G, R and
        B signals coming from the U205 are input to the OSD G, OSD R,
        OSD B of the U202. And the BLK of the U205 is input to the 1pin
        of OSD BLK to make the display period of the video signal blank.<BR>
        The signal controlled in Gain is output from R OUT, G OUT and
        B OUT.<BR>
        The Sync Separator circuit outputs the G on Sync signal at BNC
        input to the measure gate array as the composite signal at TTL
        level. The clamp pulse is input to 21pin (CP) and the video blanking
        pulse is input to 30pin (BLK). The D/A converter is used for
        the ABL and Signal Filter adjustment.<BR>
        As the Auto Sizing function, this IC detects the video signal
        of each color to output the display period of the video signal
        to the measure gate array from 17 pin (DISP).</TD>

        The IC is controlled by microprocessor (U351) through the three
        lined serial bus. The IC uses the OSD_H and OSD_V output from
        measure gate array as the sync signal. The displayed OSD signal
        which is output from R, G, B is mixed with the video signal by
        the U202.</TD>

        The video signal output from the U202 is input to 2, 8, and 12pin.
        The video signals are amplified and each signal is output from
        4, 6, 14 pin. This amplified signal drives the CRT cathode. The
        Signal Filter 1/2 function can reduce video card's smear or ghost
        by switching emitter peaking constant of U203.</TD>

        <TD>
        The cut off level of video signals is controlled in the cut off
        circuit (U204). The cut off level is controlled by changing by
        the DC level of the video signals that are output from U203 in
        the U204 output of IROUT, AIGOUT, AIBOUT. The amount of change
        is controlled by PWM output of measure-gate allay.</TD>

        The U101 has the information for product ID, serial No or corresponded
        frequency. The information is read when the minter is connected
        to the DDC computer. This IC corresponds to the DDC2B. SDA connects
        with the 12pin of D-Sub connector, SCL with 15 pin.<BR>
        The power supply of the U101 is generated from the input sync
        signal and 5V_S.</TD>
