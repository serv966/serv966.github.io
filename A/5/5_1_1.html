        <B>Horizontal Drive Circuit</B></TD> 
      </TR>
      <TR>
        <TD>
        This circuit amplifies the pulse voltage of the H.DRV the horizontal
        oscillate circuit (U602) generated and forms the shape of the
        wave.<BR>
        The horizontal drive circuit consists of the Drive FET (Q502)
        and the Drive transformer (T502). The drive current is supplied
        by the constant-current circuit (Q505 and Q506). The drive electric
        current is controlled in the DAC (U551 9pin) voltage.</TD>

        <B>Horizontal Output circuit</B></TD> 
      </TR>
      <TR>
        <TD>
        The Output transistor Q501 works as the switching function. The
        Horizontal output transistor Q501 outputs a saw-tooth current
        wave to the Deflection Yolk coil by using the Damper Diode (D501)
        and the Resonance Capacitors (C501, C502). The collector pulse
        of the Q501 is output as the H. FBP to the secondary winding
        side of the H.OUT transformer T501. This pulse drives the DC-DC
        converter circuit and is also used as the video blanking pulse.</TD>

        <B>Horizontal Linearity Correction circuit (PCB-LIN)</B></TD> 
      </TR>
      <TR>
        <TD>
        This circuit stands on the PCB-MAIN. The Linearity coils (L570,
        L571) and the Choke coil (L572, L573) are the linearity correction
        coils. And the capacitors (C571~C580) are the linearity correction
        capacitor. The Q571~Q578 are FET. The switching of the Cs condenser
        is done with FET (Q570, Q571~Q573), and a switching control signal
        is outputted from DAC (U570).</TD>

        <B>Distortion Correction Output Circuit</B></TD> 
      </TR>
      <TR>
        <TD>
        The parabola wave (S.PIN.) generated in the DSP Block, is amplified
        in the U571. The amplified wave in the U571 are superimposed
        on the H.+B voltage by the output transistor Q578 and thus distortion
        is corrected.</TD>

        <B>H.Size Control Circuit</B></TD> 
      </TR>
      <TR>
        <TD>
        The horizontal size control circuit fixes the FBP from T501 on
        the secondary winding side. That voltage is controlled by the
        voltage from the D/A converter (U551 11pin, 12pin).<BR>
        The controlled voltage is output to the Power Block as ERR (Error).
        In the Power Block, H.+B voltage is controlled by the ERR voltage
        level, and as a result, the Horizontal size is changed.</TD>

        <B>Raster Shift Control Circuit (PCB-LIN)</B></TD> 
      </TR>
      <TR>
        <TD>
        The five-step switching of the SW570 and the SW571 changes the
        inflow current to H.+B to move the raster. The SW570 controls
        the right and left movement. The SW571 controls the variable
        volume.</TD>

        <B>Vertical Deflection Block Circuit</B></TD> 
      </TR>
      <TR>
        <TD>
        The output IC (U401) amplifies the V.DRV which is generated in
        U601 and supplies the deflection current to the Vertical Deflection
        York. This wave is generated by digital, the V.DRV is staircase-saw-tooth
        waveform. If you drive this vertical output with this wave, the
        horizontal noise appears on the screen. So, the filter circuit
        (Q401~Q404) smoothes the wave and drive the vertical output circuit.
<BR>
        At the filter circuit, the V.BLK2 pulse prevents the wave bluntness
        during the vertical blanking porch. <BR>
        The V.P.DET is used at AutoSize function and protector function
        of the microprocessor at the control block. The rectangle wave
        is generated from the vertical deflection wave through the comparator.(U402)<BR>
        Because insulating is not done between U401 and AC401 radiator,
        the radiator is always impressed with VEE voltage (about 14V).
        Please be minded not to connect the radiator and chassisGND when
        you deconstruct it.</TD>

        <TD>
        The U451 and U452 are power-ope amp to drive the landing correction
        coil of 4 corners. Each correction are controlled by the voltage
        output from the D/A converter (U551).</TD>

      </TR>
      <TR>
        <TD>
        The U453 are power-ope amp to drive the V.Convergence Circuit
        and LCC. The U454 are one to drive the H.Convergence Circuit
        and Tilt. Tilt and H/V. Convergence correction are controlled
        by the voltage output from the D/A converter (U552). The LCC
        correction is controlled by that from U551. The V.Convergence
        circuit mixes and outputs the parabola wave of top-bottom division
        generated in the DSP block.</TD>
