        This circuit generates resonance voltage pulse by the switching
        of the high voltage FET (Q701) at the primary line of FBT (T701).
        It is boosted by the FBT and generates the high voltage. In order
        to stabilize the high voltage causing load changing, the high
        voltage is bled at the resistance and input to the high voltage
        control IC U701 (4 pin). This IC controls and stabilizes the
        high voltage by controlling the switching pulse width of the
        high voltage FET (Q701) . This switching pulse is output from
        the control IC 1 pin. <BR>
        If horizontal output circuit stops by some trouble, the circuit
        stops high voltage circuit by preventing input of the 2fH to
        the control IC. <BR>
        The same conventional X-ray detection method is still used. However,
        when the detection voltage (MON-XP) is input to the micro-controller,
        and the preset reference voltage is exceeded, the micro-controller
        causes entry to the power save mode, and the protector display
        is indicated on the LEDs. The reference voltage differs according
        to each individual Set. The detection voltage is read by the
        micro-controller under predetermined conditions. The voltage
        obtained by multiplying a fixed ratio becomes the reference voltage,
        and this is stored to memory. When some trouble such as layer
        shorting of the FBT secondary wiring (HV-8pin) causes the FBT
        tertiary wiring (5-7pin) output to drop, this drop is detected
        by Q724 to switch the MON-XP detection voltage to the micro-controller
        to High, and shift to protector operation in the same way.<BR>
        The voltage obtained by rectifying that waveform output from
        the 4pin and 1 pin of the FBT is used as the power supply for
        the cut off control circuit in the video circuit and VDF circuit.</TD>

        The DF wave IC (U761) generates horizontal and vertical parabola
        wave for the focus. (H.DF, V.DF). The H. DRV and V.SAW is the
        sync signal for each wave and input to the 17 and 2 pin. <BR>
        The U761 amplifies the H.DF/V.DF and controls the phase of H.DF.
        It is controlled by the output voltage from the D/A converter
        (U570). <BR>
        The H.DF is amplified and boosted at the Q760~Q762. The V.DF
        is amplified at Q763 and Q764 and impressed to the focus terminal
        (13 pin) of the FBT.</TD>
