        <TD>
        At the degauss circuit, the damped oscillation current is made
        by running the input AC current through degaussing posistor.
        Then the CRT is degaussed by running this current to the degauss
        coil. The Degauss circuit works by receiving the control signal
        &lt;ON (Hi: 5 V)/OFF (Lo: 0 V)&gt; signal from the microprocessor.
        When the ON signal comes in from the microprocessor, the small-signal
        MOS-FET (Q971) turns ON and the relay (RY001) works. The RY001
        flows the degauss current in the degauss coil.<BR>
        The signal from the microprocessor turns ON for 4 seconds (Hi:
        5V) after degaussing. After then, it keeps OFF (Lo: 0V) for 20
        seconds in order to cool the degaussing posistor.</TD>

        <TD>
        The input smoothing capacitor (C010, C071) are charged when the
        power is on. These currents are called inrush current.<BR>
        Because this excess inrush current may cause the circuit parts
        damge such as the welding of the contact point of the power SW
        and the fusion of the fuse, the inrush current prevention circuit
        is built in. <BR>
        Firstly, the current flows into the C010 and C071 through the
        inruch current prevention resistor thermistor (TH001). At this
        time, the over-current cannot flow because the TH001 limits the
        current. The power circuit starts operating and then with a time
        lag the RY002 is ON. The current supplied through the TH001 comes
        to flow through the RY002.</TD>

            If the power SW turns ON, the Q031 turns ON. Then the operation
            current runs to the Vcc terminal (7pin) of the control IC: U071
            for the sub-converter through the operation resistance R035~R037.
            Then the sub-converter starts working. Then, the Q031 turns OFF
            and the operation circuit stops. The tertiary winding output
            of T003 is changed to DC15V through the IC-REGULATOR and supplied
            to the Vcc of the U071.<BR>
            The circuit charges the transformer (T003) with energy during
            the switch element (Q072) is on. And the circuit transfer the
            energy to the T003 secondary line from primary line and supplies
            the rectified and smoothed voltage through each output rectification
            diode (D907) and smoothing electrolytic capacitors (C911, C916)

            The output voltage is detected by the R908 and R909. It is input

            After the sub-converter is operated, the main-converter circuit
            receives the control signal (AP) from the microprocessor to start
            operating.<BR>
            When the AP becomes high (5V), the Q902 is ON to flow the current
            in the photo coupler (PC004) and to transmit the high signal
            from the secondary line to the primary line. The signal turns
            the Q932 ON. The tertiary winding output 15V of the sub-converter
            is supplied to the Vcc terminal (4pin) of the control IC (U001)
            of the main-converter. Then the circuit operates. The IC has
            a main switching element and a sub switching element for the
            dummy resonant.<BR>
            When the main switching element is on, the circuit charges energy
            in the transformer T001. And when the main switching element
            is off, the circuit release the energy to the secondary line
            of the transformer T001 and outputs rectified and smoothed voltage
            through rectification diode and smoothing electrolytic capacitor.
            The principle of the operation is same as before.<BR>
            The output voltage control varies ON duty of the main switching
            element through the control IC (U001) in order to keep the output
            voltage of the 85V line.<BR>
            The output voltage is detected by the R984, R985 and VR981. It
            is input to the SHUNT-REGULATOR (U981:IC for the reference voltage)
            The FEED-BACK output is transmitted to the primary line by the
            photo coupler (PC001) and fed back to the control IC (U001 7pin).
            The control IC works to keep the voltage fed back constant. The
            switching frequency synchronizes with 2fH.<BR>
            At PowerSave Mode, the control signal AP from the microprocessor
            turns low level to stop operating the main-converter circuit.</TD>

            The sub switching element does the dummy resonant operation so
            that the main switching element can start in 0V in order to reduce
            the switching loss of the main switching element. The sub switching
            element turns ON 250nS earlier than the main switching element
            does to let the drain voltage of the main switching element resonate
            by the resonant capacitor (C021), the main transformer (T001)
            and the choking coil (L012). The dummy resonant operation starts
            when the main switching element turns 0V. Thus this function
            reduces the loss of the main switching element. In addition,
            although the main switching element is OFF, the main switching
            OFF wave stands up smoothly because the C021 is inserted to reduce

            When the control IC(U001) is on and drain current of the main
